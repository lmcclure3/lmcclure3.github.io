# CommWebsite
My website contains two pages, one home page and one resume page with download link. In the future I plan on updating my website by adding more pages for projects, contact me,and other information. I'm still new to web development so I would like to learn more about how to host my projects online.  I would also like to add more pictures to fill in space better and make the page more interesting to look at. I would also like to add more interactive elements to the page. I've seen interesting designs that cause the website to move similar to the way that apple does it with their website but probably less complex as I sometimes find navigating those pages to be a hassle. I would probably need to learn more about javascript. I have some experience from writing google sheets scripts but never in a web development context. Previously I've built simple html websites using style elements so learning css has been a lot of fun especially playing around in inspect to try and make all the elements work together. Although I may prefer the backend, this assignment has been a lot of fun and eye opening. When you open up a website you can really see the different elements and know how things are working together.
