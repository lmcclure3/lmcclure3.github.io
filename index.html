		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I am currently at Illinois Institute of Technology working towards a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I have remained driven throughout my first 3 semesters maintaining a 4.0 GPA and making the dean's list each semester all while being a semester ahead of peers through AP credits. 
		</p>
		<h2>Soccer</h2>
		<p>
			I have been a soccer fan and player ever since I could walk. I became a referee when I was 12 working competitive youth, adult, and college games. most recently I became a referee mentor in 2022 where I work with young referees to help them learn how to be great referees
